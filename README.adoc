= Asciidoctor Runner (ADRunner)
This is a simple application that can be used to translate a AsciiDoc document
into a HTML document with out the need to install Ruby if you already have
Java installed.

I will add feature as time permits that will enable more customization. But for
now you must specify your configuration in your AsciiDoc file itself. You do this
by setting
http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#setting-attributes-on-a-document[attributes]
in the header of your document. To see an example of this take a look at any of the
files in my https://github.com/rdjack21/Notes[Notes] repository. Just remember that
you want the raw file and if you have the asciidoctor viewer installed you will want
to turn that off as well.
